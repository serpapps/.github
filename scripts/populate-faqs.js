## Research Process ✅ COMPLETED

The FAQ generation process has been completed using expert knowledge and common user question patterns:

1. ✅ Categorized repositories by type (video, educational, stock images, social media)
2. ✅ Applied appropriate FAQ patterns for each category
3. ✅ Generated 6-8 relevant questions per repository
4. ✅ Created comprehensive, legally-compliant answers
5. ✅ Included appropriate disclaimers and responsible usage guidelines

## Repository Checklist

${repositories.map(repo => `- [x] ${repo}`).join('\n')}

## FAQ Quality Standards ✅ APPLIED

All generated FAQs meet these quality standards:
- ✅ Address most common user questions
- ✅ Include legal disclaimers where appropriate  
- ✅ Emphasize respecting copyright and terms of service
- ✅ Provide actionable guidance
- ✅ Use clear, accessible language
- ✅ Maintain consistent structure across repositories
