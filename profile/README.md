Welcome

This is the official area for [SERP](https://serp.co/) software product releases with a dedicated repository for each of our applications.

Each product has it's own [repository](https://github.com/orgs/serpapps/repositories) for:

1. **ISSUES**: Submit any issues related to support questions, bugs and feature suggestions in the `/issues` are of the relevant application's repository.
2. **RELEASES**: Download the latest version of the application, read the full changelog of updates, access previous releases, and pre-releases if you want to try out the next version before it's official. These are located at the main repository URL + `/releases`
3. [**DISCUSSIONS**](https://github.com/orgs/serpapps/discussions): This is the "help center" where you'll find answers to FAQs and help articles
4. [**PROJECTS**](https://github.com/orgs/serpapps/projects): Follow along with development progress, view roadmaps and see what features are currently being worked on.
5. **SUPPORT**: If you need help submit you can submit a general [SUPPORT ISSUE](https://github.com/serpapps/support/issues) here, or you can submit an issue for a specific application in the app's repository `/issues` area.

We also have a free community called [SERP University](https://serp.ly/@serp/community) you can join to connect with the SERP team, other users, discuss features, share tips, etc. This is not a "support forum" so do not post your support-related questions here.

## About SERP Downloaders

There are alot of places online to upload your work, and even more [file formats](https://serptools.github.io/files/) you could publish your creations in.

Many of them have poor user experience for creators and uploaders (even the really really big ones). 

And many of them dissapear after a while. 

As a creator there are too many factors that hinder your ability to save, retreive and backup your content -- even the RAW creation doesnt match the published output sometimes due to metadata, captions, thumbnails, etc.

So part of our effort with SERP Apps is to provide creators a way to quickly and conveniently download and save the various types of content they have uploaded around the web.

That is the vision behind the SERP Downloaders.

We hope that you will use them to save the content you worked so hard to create, and we do recognize that they could be used for less-than-above-board endeavors... but what couldn't? If we stopped building everything that could be used for a malicious purpose the World (and especially the internet) would be filled with ... nothing.

Use these downloaders on your own content, that you have rights to. 

And be a proprietor of good  buggery... I mean buffoonery!
