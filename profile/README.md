This is the official area for [SERP](https://serp.co/) software product releases with a dedicated repository for each of our applications.

Each product has it's own [repository](https://github.com/orgs/serpapps/repositories) for:

1. **ISSUES**: Submit any issues related to support questions, bugs and feature suggestions.
2. **RELEASES**: Download the latest version of the application - with a full changelog of the updates, or access previous versions.
3. **WIKI**: Relevant documentation, setup instructions, FAQs, etc.
4. **PROJECTS**: Track development progress, view roadmaps, and see what features are currently being worked on.

There is also a [DISCUSSIONS](https://github.com/orgs/serpapps/discussions) area that contains general information like [FAQs](https://github.com/orgs/serpapps/discussions/categories/faq), [Tips](https://github.com/orgs/serpapps/discussions/categories/tips), etc.
