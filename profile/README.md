Welcome

This is the official area for [SERP](https://serp.co/) software product releases with a dedicated repository for each of our applications.

Each product has it's own [repository](https://github.com/orgs/serpapps/repositories) for:

1. **ISSUES**: Submit any issues related to support questions, bugs and feature suggestions in the `/issues` are of the relevant application's repository.
2. **RELEASES**: Download the latest version of the application and read the full changelog of updates, or access previous versions.
3. [**DISCUSSIONS**](https://github.com/orgs/serpapps/discussions): This is the "help center" where you will find answers to [frequently asked questions](https://github.com/orgs/serpapps/discussions/categories/faq), [how-tos](https://github.com/orgs/serpapps/discussions/categories/how-tos) and even [pre-release](https://github.com/orgs/serpapps/discussions/categories/pre-release) versions of apps if you want to try out the next release before it's official.
4. [**PROJECTS**](https://github.com/orgs/serpapps/projects): Track development progress, view roadmaps, and see what features are currently being worked on.
5. [**SUPPORT**](https://support.serp.co): If you are having issues installing/using/etc. an application submit a support request (aka ticket) here.

We also have a free community called [SERP University](https://serp.ly/@serp/community) you can join to connect with the SERP team, other users, discuss features, share tips, etc. This is not a "support forum" so do not post your support-related questions here.
